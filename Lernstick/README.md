# Lernstick
[Lernstick](https://lernstick.ch) is a Linux distribution for schools and universities. It can be also used for BYOD exams in combination with [CAMPLA](https://campla.github.io/) or [GLaDOS](https://glados-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

* Lernstick is an active contributor to Keylime
* Lernstick is interested using Keylime to ensure all devices are in a trusted state during an exam without relying on human intervention
* We are in the proof-of-concept stage of integrating Keylime with our custom middleware ([Lernstick Bridge](https://github.com/Lernstick/Lernstick-Bridge)) into our exam solutions
